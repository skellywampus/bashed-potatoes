# Bashed Potatoes

**Bashed Potatoes** is a minimal, menu-driven environment for Debian-based systems. It provides a user-friendly, text-based interface for managing common system tasks without relying heavily on manual command-line work. After setup, the system automatically logs in as root and presents a menu from which you can manage packages, browse the web, open a file manager, monitor the system, manage drives, customize menu entries, create and restore Timeshift snapshots, and more.

## Features

- **Automatic Login as Root:**  
  Once set up, the system boots straight into a root session with the custom menu.
  
- **User-Friendly Menu Interface:**  
  Powered by `dialog` and `fzf`, the menu is navigable with arrow keys and simple prompts.
  
- **No Need to Memorize Commands:**  
  Manage packages (APT), mount/unmount drives, adjust Wi-Fi networks (via `nmtui`), and run Timeshift snapshots without typing complex commands.
  
- **Easily Customize the Menu:**  
  Add or remove custom entries on-the-fly. Integrate your own shortcuts or scripts into the menu system.

- **Timeshift Integration:**  
  Create and restore system snapshots directly from the menu, ensuring easy system recovery points.

- **Run Shell Commands:**  
  If needed, there's an option to run arbitrary shell commands directly from the menu.

## Dependencies & Requirements

- A minimal Debian (or compatible) installation.
- Root or sudo privileges to run the setup script initially.
- Internet access during initial setup to install required packages.
  
**Installed Packages Include:**
- `dialog`, `fzf` for menu interface
- `mc` (Midnight Commander) for file management
- `links2` for web browsing
- `network-manager` and `nmtui` for network configuration
- `btop` for system monitoring
- `timeshift` for system snapshots
- `ncdu` for disk usage analysis
- `tldr` for quick command examples

## Setup Instructions

1. **Start from a Minimal Debian System:**  
   Install a fresh minimal Debian system or a Debian-based VM.

2. **Obtain the Script:**  
   Clone this repository:
   ```bash```
   ```git clone https://github.com/skellywampus/bashed-potatoes.git```
   ```cd bashed-potatoes```

3. **Run the Setup Script as Root:**

    ```sudo ./setup_script.sh```

    You will be prompted to:
        Set the root password

    Follow the on-screen prompts.

    ##Reboot:##
    After the script finishes, on reboot, the system will automatically log you in as root and present the Bashed Potatoes menu.

##Usage

    ##Navigation:##
    Use the arrow keys and Enter to choose options. Pressing ESC or selecting "back" returns you to the previous menu.

    ##Running Programs:##
    When you select an option (e.g., file), it launches the program. Exiting programs returns you to the menu.

    ##Managing Drives:##
    Under system -> drives, you can view a list of partitions and manually type in the partition and mount point to mount, or choose a mounted partition to unmount.

    ##APT Management:##
    Under apt, you can update, install, and remove packages from a menu interface.

    ##Customization:##
    Under customize, add your own menu entries or remove existing custom entries.

    ##Timeshift Snapshots:##
    Under system -> timeshift, create or restore system snapshots easily.

    ##Exit to Terminal:##
    Selecting exit from the main menu returns you to a standard root shell.

##Removing the Menu System

If you later decide you don't want this environment, select the "remove_menu" option (if present) or remove files manually (such as /usr/local/bin/menu, /etc/profile.d/aliases.sh, and the lines added to /etc/profile). Also restore your /etc/systemd/system/getty@tty1.service.d/override.conf to remove autologin.
